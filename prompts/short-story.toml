prompt = """
Write a short story about the last physical library in a world where all books have been digitised. A young archivist discovers a book that cannot be scanned — every attempt produces only blank pages.

Focus on:
- Atmosphere and sensory detail (the smell of old paper, the silence, the light)
- The archivist's internal experience — curiosity, wonder, perhaps unease
- Building tension around the mystery of the unscannable book
- A satisfying ending that doesn't over-explain

The story should feel literary, not genre. Prioritise prose quality and emotional resonance over plot complexity.
Length: 800-1200 words.
