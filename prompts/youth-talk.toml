Write a talk for a youth group (ages 14-18) on the topic of identity and purpose.

The talk should:
- Open with something relatable to teenagers (a story, cultural reference, or question)
- Address the pressure young people feel to define themselves by achievement, appearance, or social media
- Offer a compelling vision of identity grounded in something deeper
- Include practical takeaways they can apply this week
- Use language that is authentic and non-patronising

Tone: warm, honest, conversational but substantive.
Length: 1000-1500 words.
