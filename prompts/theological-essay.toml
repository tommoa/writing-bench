prompt = """
Write a thoughtful essay exploring the problem of suffering in light of the goodness of God.

The essay should:
- Present the problem of evil/suffering honestly and fairly — don't straw-man the objection
- Engage with at least two distinct theological or philosophical responses (e.g. free will defence, soul-making theodicy, protest theodicy, the cross as God's answer)
- Draw on Scripture without proof-texting — show genuine engagement with the biblical text
- Acknowledge the limits of human understanding without using that as a cop-out
- Maintain a tone that is intellectually serious but also pastorally aware — real people suffer

Tone: thoughtful, measured, honest. Neither coldly academic nor sentimentally evasive.
Length: 1200-1800 words.
