description = "Tests ability to blend personal narrative with reflection and literary prose"

prompt = """
Write a personal essay about a specific place that profoundly shaped who you are.

The essay should:
- Ground the reader in a real, vivid sense of place — sights, sounds, smells, textures
- Tell a story, not just describe — something happened in this place that changed you
- Move between scene and reflection: show the place, then explore what it means
- Resist easy sentimentality — earn the emotion through specificity and honesty
- Arrive somewhere surprising — the ending should reveal something the beginning didn't promise

Tone: literary, personal, reflective. Think Annie Dillard or James Baldwin, not a travel blog.
Length: 1000-1500 words.
