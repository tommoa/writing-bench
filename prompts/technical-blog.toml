name = "Technical Blog: Database Migration at Scale"
tags = ["technical", "analytical"]
description = "Tests ability to explain complex technical concepts clearly and engagingly"

prompt = """
Write a technical blog post about migrating a production database from PostgreSQL to a distributed database (e.g. CockroachDB, TiDB, or YugabyteDB) at a company processing 50,000 requests per second.

The post should:
- Open with the business problem that motivated the migration (not just "we needed to scale")
- Walk through the key technical decisions: schema changes, data migration strategy, dual-write vs CDC, rollback plan
- Include at least one specific technical challenge encountered and how it was solved
- Discuss the trade-offs honestly — what was gained, what was lost
- End with lessons learned that readers can apply to their own migrations

Tone: technically precise but human — the voice of an experienced engineer sharing hard-won knowledge, not a product marketing piece.
Audience: senior backend engineers and infrastructure leads.
Length: 1500-2000 words.
