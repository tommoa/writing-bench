prompt = """
Write a talk for a youth group (ages 14-18) about doubt and faith.

The talk should:
- Open with a story or scenario that normalises doubt -- make it safe to admit uncertainty
- Acknowledge that doubt is a normal part of growing up and growing in faith, not a sign of failure
- Explore at least one biblical figure who wrestled with doubt (e.g. Thomas, David, Job, Habakkuk)
- Offer a vision of how honest questions can deepen faith rather than destroy it
- Avoid clichés and pat answers -- teenagers can spot inauthenticity instantly
- End with a practical next step (a question to sit with, a conversation to have, a practice to try)

Tone: honest, warm, conversational. Treat the audience as intelligent people wrestling with real questions.
Language: natural and unforced -- not trying to sound "cool" or preachy.
Length: 1000-1500 words.
