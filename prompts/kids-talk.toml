prompt = """
Write a short talk for children aged 5-10 about kindness, based on the parable of the Good Samaritan (Luke 10:25-37).

The talk should:
- Start with a question, a simple story from everyday life, or a "what would you do?" scenario that hooks kids immediately
- Retell the parable in vivid, child-friendly language (not watered down, but accessible)
- Help children understand why the Samaritan's actions were surprising and important
- Draw out a clear, memorable lesson about showing kindness to everyone -- not just friends
- End with one concrete thing they can do this week to be a "Good Samaritan"

Tone: warm, enthusiastic, and fun -- like a favourite teacher, not a lecture.
Language: simple vocabulary, short sentences, conversational. Use sensory details and dialogue to bring the story alive.
Length: 500-800 words.
